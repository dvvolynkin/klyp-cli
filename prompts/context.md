## Project Overview: Klyp-CLI

Klyp-CLI is a command-line utility designed to streamline the process of managing and consolidating text from various source files, primarily for constructing well-formed prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Core Purpose:**
To provide developers and content creators with a simple yet effective tool to:
1.  Define "scopes" â€“ logical collections of code files relevant to a specific task or context.
2.  Optionally associate a "context file" with each scope, containing preparatory information, system messages, or general instructions.
3.  Quickly assemble the content of the context file, a structured list of files in the scope, and the actual content of those files into a single block.
4.  Copy this assembled block to the clipboard or print it to standard output for easy use with LLMs or other text-processing tools.

**Key Problems Addressed:**
-   Manually copying and pasting multiple files and instructions for LLM prompts is tedious and error-prone.
-   Maintaining consistency in prompt structure across different tasks can be challenging.
-   Lack of a simple way to version or share common prompt components (like project overview or coding guidelines) within a project.

**Target Audience:**
-   Software developers interacting with LLMs for code generation, explanation, refactoring, or documentation.
-   Content creators using LLMs for tasks that require structured input from multiple text sources.
-   Anyone needing to quickly aggregate and format text from a project directory.

This tool aims for simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to focus on their tasks rather than the mechanics of prompt assembly.
